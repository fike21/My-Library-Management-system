  üìö My Library Management System
‚ú® Project Overview
The My Library Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate the core operations of a library. It aims to efficiently manage library resources, user interactions, and the borrowing process, enhancing organization and accessibility.

üöÄ Features
Book Cataloging: Efficiently add, update, search, and manage a vast collection of books with detailed information (title, author, publication year, total copies, etc.).
User Management: Register and maintain user accounts, securely storing essential details and managing user roles.
Secure Authentication: Implement robust user authentication with securely hashed and salted passwords.
Borrowing & Returns: Track the issuance of books to users and their subsequent returns, including due dates and return date recording.
Availability Tracking: Monitor the real-time availability of books within the library.
Search & Filtering: Powerful search capabilities to quickly locate books and users.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Database: SQL Server (Your robust data storage solution)
Database Management: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) (For database design, querying, and administration)
(Action for you: Add your application's programming language and framework here. E.g., C# / .NET, Python / Django, Java / Spring Boot, PHP / Laravel, Node.js / Express, etc.)
üèÅ Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the My Library Management System on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

SQL Server: Any edition (e.g., SQL Server Express for local development, Developer Edition, Standard Edition).
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): To interact with your SQL Server instance.
(Action for you: Add your application's specific prerequisites here. E.g., .NET SDK, Python 3.x, Java JDK 11+, Node.js, npm/yarn.)
Database Setup
Create the Database:
Open SSMS and connect to your SQL Server instance. Execute the following SQL to create your database (you can replace MyLibraryDB with your preferred name):

SQL

CREATE DATABASE MyLibraryDB;
GO
USE MyLibraryDB;
GO
Apply Schema Migrations:
You'll need to run the SQL scripts to create all necessary tables (Users, Books, IssueBooks, etc.) and apply the schema changes we've implemented (like PasswordHash, Salt, TotalCopies, and ReturnDate as DATE).

(Action for you: Ideally, point to a .sql file in your repository that contains all your CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements. If you don't have one, create it! For example: src/Database/Schema.sql)

SQL

-- Example (Replace with your actual comprehensive schema script)
-- Execute the SQL script located at 'src/Database/Schema.sql' in SSMS.
-- Or, if you have your CREATE TABLE statements here:

CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Username NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    PasswordHash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- For securely stored password hash
    Salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,           -- For password hashing salt
    Email NVARCHAR(100),
    -- ... other user details (e.g., FullName, PhoneNumber)
);

CREATE TABLE Books (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Title NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Author NVARCHAR(100),
    ISBN NVARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    PublicationYear INT,
    TotalCopies INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- Total copies in the library
    AvailableCopies INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- Copies currently not issued
    -- ... other book details (e.g., Genre, Publisher)
);

CREATE TABLE IssueBooks (
    IssueID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    BookID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Books(BookID),
    UserID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    IssueDate DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    ReturnDate DATE, -- The date the book was actually returned (can be NULL if not yet returned)
    DueDate DATE, -- The date the book is expected back
    -- ... any other relevant fields for tracking issues
);
-- Add any other tables like 'Authors', 'Genres', 'Admins', etc. as needed.
Application Setup
(This section is highly dependent on your actual application's code. Here's a general template.)

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-library-management-system.git
cd my-library-management-system
Configure Database Connection:
Locate your application's configuration file (common examples: appsettings.json for .NET, .env for Laravel/Node.js, settings.py for Django, application.properties for Spring Boot). Update the database connection string to point to your MyLibraryDB instance.

Example (appsettings.json for .NET Core):

JSON

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=MyLibraryDB;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}
(Adjust Server, Database, and authentication method as per your SQL Server setup.)

Install Dependencies:

Bash

# For .NET (in your project's root directory):
dotnet restore

# For Python (if using pip, in your project's root directory):
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Node.js (in your project's root directory):
npm install
Run the Application:

Bash

# For .NET:
dotnet run

# For Python (e.g., Django):
python manage.py runserver

# For Node.js (e.g., Express app):
npm start
Your application should now be running and accessible, typically via http://localhost:[port] (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
